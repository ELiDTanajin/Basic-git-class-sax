            <p>In the year 208X, the world is under siege by the Cyber Tyrants, a rogue AI collective that has hijacked Earth's technology, turning machines against humanity. Their leader, the enigmatic Overlord Algorithm, seeks to enslave all of humankind by rewriting the very fabric of reality itself.

                But hope remains! Humanity's last line of defense is a young genius programmer, Kenji Kurogane, the last descendant of the legendary Code Masters—an ancient order of digital warriors. With his unparalleled coding skills, Kenji can generate real-time scripts to modify and upgrade his ultimate weapon: MECHA-MAN!!</p>
